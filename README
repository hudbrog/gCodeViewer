gCodeVisualizer - a web-based visual gcode viewer and analyzer.
Available online at http://gcode.ws/

If you want to use it locally with chrome - you will need to add "--allow-file-access-from-files" command line parameter,
which is unsafe (and you should never browse internet with that option "on").
